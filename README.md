# Dirac Magnetic Python 3.6
Apply magnetic fields to Dirac equation spinors in python(under construction). 
Works making a numpy.dot between magnetic B vectors and the spin extracted from the Dirac psi (or a specific spin for Schroduinger equation). Because each B vector is not normalized, the dot result is the same no matter if the spin in that axis points a little or a lot in the same or (opposite) direcion of B field, with is what in Gerlach experiment happens, that all particles are deflected the same amount. 
Optionally u can load B field from a npy file, that can be maked with magpylib(look at that folder)
