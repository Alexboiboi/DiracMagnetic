# Dirac Magnetic Python 3.6 OpenGL QT5
Apply magnetic fields to Dirac equation spinors in python(under construction).
Based on marl0ny Dirac examples from Github.https://github.com/marl0ny/split-operator-simulations 

Works making a numpy.dot between magnetic B vectors and the spin extracted from the Dirac psi (or a specific spin for Schroduinger equation). 
For a good B Gerlach field u load it from a npy file, that can be maked with magpylib(in that folder there is the script gerlach.py for make the B npy file)
